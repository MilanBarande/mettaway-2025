        <p className="mb-4">
          As Laser Sun completes its seventh orbit around Point 0, the mighty Space Council 
          once again hosts the METTA GAMES: four days of challenges requiring combined strength, 
          skills and collaboration during the day, followed by lavish festivities at night. 
          Star athletes from all over the universe gather to demonstrate and celebrate the 
          power of community.

        <p className="mb-4">
          As a representative of your species, you have been preparing for this moment your 
          entire life: <strong>You are in.</strong>
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Mission:</strong> The Metta Games are a prolonged weekend among space friends â€” 
          everyone partaking is responsible for their success and every helping hand, tentacle, 
          or telekinetic power is needed.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Timeline:</strong> Our 6th journey will last from November 21st to November 25th 
          the year #2024 in earth time. Early arrival on Thursday morning to build up the arena is 
          possible, as a small group of space coaches will prepare the athletes&apos; quarters.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Coordinates:</strong> The Metta Games will take place at a location that has 
          proven itself during past journeys. You will be provided with further info after signup.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          If you&apos;d like to join, please fill out the following scroll and wire the money 
          (only earth payment accepted: the outer worlds and galactic ones would generate some 
          unnecessary fees). Participants will be chosen by first come, first served. There will 
          be a waiting list once all outpost beds are reserved.

          Please remember: There are a few agreements the Intergalactic Space Council came to 
          terms with after the sixth big bang to ensure harmony and prevent further universal resets:
